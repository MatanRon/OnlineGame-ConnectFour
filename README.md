# Connect-Four
In this project I implemented an online version of my favorite children's game: "Connect Four". 
Chat between players is also included :)


This program has two running modes (only one at a time):

1. Server Mode - Manages the game. Receives incoming communication from client applications, calculates board status and distributes messages between customers.

2. Client mode - the user interface for the game (connects to the server using the TCP protocol).
Commands are received from the player, and sent to the server. Also, the software receives updates from the server, and displays it to the player.


Connect Four is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs


Enjoy
